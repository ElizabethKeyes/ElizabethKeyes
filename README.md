### Hi there 👋
My name is Elizabeth. I'm a software developer with a passion for logical thinking and problem solving, skills that directly play into my ever-growing board game habit. I'm glad you've found my page, here's some more about me ~
  
* ✨ When I first discovered software development, it quickly became an interest of mine. The large amount of rational thinking involved really grabbed my attention from the beginning. I thrive in a logical environment, so this is an avenue I've continually loved to explore.
* 🧠 Writing code is one of the most satisfying and rewarding skills I have. The ability to create an easy-to-understand representation of an idea, knowing that it will work exactly as written every time is fascinating. (Please note, I didn't say work *correctly*, just that it will work *as written*. That's a very important distinction. 😉)
* 🎨 On the flip side of all this logical thinking, coding is truly an art form in my opinion. I haven't resonated with a lot of "traditional" artistic expression, but coding is a great way to flex that creativity muscle.
* 🧑‍💻 My strongest languages/frameworks include HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (including NodeJs and MVC structure), and C# (.NET)
* 💾 Familiar with document & table database structure, primarily MongoDB and MySQL.
